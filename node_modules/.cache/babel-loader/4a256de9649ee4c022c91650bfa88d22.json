Much research has been reported on building accurate machine learning classifiers to identifying bots in social networks; recent works on social bots have started the new line of research on the existence, placement, and functions of the bots in a collective manner. In this paper, we study two families of Twitter bots which have been studied previously with respect to spamming activities through advertisement and political campaigns, and perform an evolutionary comparison with the new waves of bots currently found in Twitter. We uncover various evolved tendencies of the new social bots under social, communication, and behavioral patterns. Our findings show that these bots demonstrate evolved core-periphery structure; are deeply embedded in their networks of communication; exhibit complex information diffusion and heterogeneous content authoring patterns; perform mobilization of leaders across communication roles; and reside in niche topic communities. These characteristics make them highly deceptive as well as more effective in achieving operational goals than their traditional counterparts.

Insights of user behavior and network interactions can be applied to practical applications like targeted advertising, viral marketing, political campaigns, etc. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Feed Weighted Topic Embeddings (MFWTE) model to study user network interaction and topic diffusion patterns on Twitter. Our method extracts topic embeddings from multiple views of a Twitter user feed and weights them according to their content authoring roles, where the authored tweets, replied tweets, retweeted tweets, and favorited tweets are the views we separate for constructing the embeddings. We test the proposed method using two different topic modeling algorithms: (i) Latent Dirichlet Allocation (ii) Twitter-Latent Dirichlet Allocation. The users in our study are divided into multiple hierarchies based on their activity composition regarding individual topics, and the effectiveness of MFWTE is evaluated in the multi-hierarchical setting. The performance of our method on friendship recommendation and retweet behavior prediction task is evaluated using various ranked retrieval measures. The results indicate that our MFWTE method for topic modeling of Twitter users improves over various previous baselines. We conclude our work by applying the proposed model, MFWTE to discover various information diffusion patterns on Twitter.\",\n    href: \"http://pujanpaudel.com/bdc.pdf\",\n    thumbnail: \"http://pujanpaudel.com/bdcatlogo.png\",\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 18\n    },\n    __self: this\n  }), React.createElement(Lists, {\n    title: \"The Devil is in the Details\",\n    description: \"Twitter bots have been exercised by political parties and state-level agencies in many contexts.
